| April 5      |   9-10pm   |                                                                                                                                        I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |

| Novemeber 18 | 9:50-10:30 | contniue to work on creating my first attempt at compressing the bitmap. I currently trying to count number zeros then number ones and save only that hopefully will be less info |
| November 19  | 9-9:50 am  |                                                 Finished making the first draft of the compressor and started to work on the expander. Trying to shift from using strings to ints |
| Novemeber 19 | 8-8:30 pm  |                                                                                         First draft didn't work so tried to edit and change the code around, but like my approach |
| November 22  | 12:50-1:33 |                                                            Continued working on code. Changed it to assume code starts on 0 so I no longer need to save if the number was 0 or 1. |
